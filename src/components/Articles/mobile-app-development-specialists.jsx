      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          1. What qualifications do mobile app development specialists typically
          have?
        </strong>
        Mobile app development specialists often have a degree in computer
        science or a related field and relevant certifications. However,
        practical experience and a strong portfolio are equally important.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. How long does it take to develop a mobile app?</strong> The
        time it takes to develop a mobile app depends on various factors such as
        complexity, features, and the development approach. Simple apps may take
        a few months, while more complex projects can take a year or longer.
      </p>

        <strong>
          3. Can mobile app development specialists help with app marketing and
          promotion?
        </strong>
        While app development specialists focus on building the app itself, many
        agencies offer additional services such as app marketing and promotion
        to help businesses reach their target audience and drive app downloads.

      <p>
        <strong>

        JavaScript) to create apps that run on multiple platforms but may
        sacrifice performance.
